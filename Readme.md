61 lines.

## NanoBounceV2.java

NanoBounceV2.java reduces the line count further by switching to a for loop, where the x-axis number, which is the value of the current iteration of the for-loop, is used to determine its position on the y-axis by a modulo-10. Additionally, all methods and variables were removed and replaced with literals when possible.
